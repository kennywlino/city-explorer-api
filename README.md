# City Explorer API

**Author**: Kenny W. Lino

**Version**: 1.0.2

## Overview

This application serves as the back-end to the [City Explorer](https://github.com/kennywlino/city-explorer) front-end.

## Getting Started

In order to get started, you can visit the deployed version at: [city-explorer-kwl-cf.netlify.app](https://city-explorer-kwl-cf.netlify.app)

If you'd like to explore just the back-end portion, you can deploy it locally by downloading this repo and using `npm install` to install the dependencies. From there, you can start the server with `npm start` and use `nodemon` in the terminal to view the output or look at `localhost`. You can set the localhost PORT variable in your own `.env` following `.env-sample`.

## Architecture

This project utilizes JavaScript and the Express library to handle the server.
